- **Military**: Swordsmen ⚔️ · Gunmen 🔫 · Cavalry Swordsmen 🐴 · Cavalry Gunmen 🏇 · Special Guard 🛡️ · Medium Cannons 💣 · Large Cannons 🎯 · Small/Medium/Large Ships 🚢

### Buildings & Factories

Each building can be upgraded through multiple levels. Higher levels produce more resources per weekly cycle:

- Farm · Animal Farm · Clothes Factory · Bank
- Military camps and shipyards for each unit type
